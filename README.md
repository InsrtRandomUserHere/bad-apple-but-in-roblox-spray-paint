# bad-apple-but-in-roblox-spray-paint

This was just some random dumb idea I had so i made it. I forgot where I copied the `directKeys.py` and `directKeys2.py` from, and they were from different sources so that's why it's in two different files. <br>


# Requirements
1. Roblox
2. [OP Auto Clicker](https://www.opautoclicker.com)
3. ffmpeg
4. a lot of free time

# Set-up
## Roblox Spray paint
1. Find a good area to draw on (I recommend using freecam)
2. Open your spray paint
3. Expand the color picker panel to expose the advanced color pickers
4. I recommend using safe mode, because a lot of people do try to ruin your art
## OP Auto Clicker
1. Set mode to `Repeat`
2. Set `Repeat` to 2 times
3. Click interval is at 0ms
## Bad apple frames
1. Download the Bad Apple video using your choice of downloader (I recommend yt-dlp)
2. Using ffmpeg, use the command `ffmpeg -i bad_apple.mp4 frame_%04d.png` **INSIDE OF THE BAD APPLE FRAMES FOLDER**
